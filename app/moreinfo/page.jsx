        London was founded by the Romans as Londinium around AD 43. Over the
        centuries, it grew into the political, cultural, and economic center of
        England and later the entire United Kingdom. It's been home to monarchs,
        revolutions, plagues, fires (like the Great Fire of 1666), and some of
        the world's most significant historical events.
